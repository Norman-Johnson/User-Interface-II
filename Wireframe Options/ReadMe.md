# Wireframes

From the images above, chose a wireframe to guide your design for today's project. Remember that your final project must include:

- [ ]  A navigation bar with `About`, `Projects`, and `Contact` pages
- [ ]  Gallery of projects created with flexbox - you may use random images in place of project screenshots for now with the random image link: https://picsum.photos/ or you may use images that mean something to you.
- [ ]  Information about you in place of the given placeholder
- [ ]  A `My Projects` button (doesn't need to be functional)
- [ ]  A `Contact Me` button (doesn't need to be functional)
- [ ]  Link navigation items to new HTML pages

Some choices are easier than others, pick something that feels right to you. 

1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantic HTML uses tags that describe what the element is.

2. Name two big differences between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`.

'display: block;' takes up 100% of the size and pushes everything to a new line. It can be given a height or width.
Display'display: inline; only takes up the space needed, and doesn't create a new line.  It can not be given height, or width.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?

Margin
Padding
Border
Content

4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: `align-items: center`?

The main axis.

5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

Multiple people can work on the same part of the project "document" simultaneously without compromising the original, or the work the others are doing.
